# Linear_regreesion
This project aims to build a Linear Regression model to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by customers on an ecommerce platform based on various user behavior metrics.

# Steps Performed
### Data Loading & Exploration

Loaded the dataset using pandas

Displayed basic info and statistics using .info() and .describe()

Checked for missing values

### Data Visualization

Used seaborn and matplotlib for:

Pair plots

Heatmaps for correlation

Regression plots between key variables and the target

### Feature Selection

Selected numerical features relevant to prediction

Target variable: Yearly Amount Spent

Considered features: Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, Length of Membership

### Model Building

Split data into train/test sets using train_test_split from sklearn

Built and trained a Linear Regression model using LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model

### Model Evaluation

Evaluated using metrics like:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
